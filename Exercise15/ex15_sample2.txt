A few fancy things are going on in this file, so let's break it down real quick:

Lines 1-3 uses argv to get a filename. Next we have line 5 where we use a new command open.
Right now, run pydoc open and read the instructions. Notice how like your own scripts and raw_input,
it takes a parameter and returns a value you can set to your own variable. You just opened a file.
